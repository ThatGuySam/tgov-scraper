00:06:56,128 --> 00:06:56,809
<v Speaker 08>Yes.</v>

165
00:06:57,509 --> 00:06:58,550
<v Speaker 08>Yes.</v>

166

<v Speaker 08>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 08>Yes.</v>

168
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:01,173
<v Speaker 08>Yes.</v>

169
00:07:01,293 --> 00:07:01,933
<v Speaker 08>Yes.</v>

170
00:07:02,274 --> 00:07:02,694
<v Speaker 08>Yes.</v>

171
00:07:04,135 --> 00:07:04,335
<v Speaker 19>All right.</v>

172
00:07:04,396 --> 00:07:05,356
<v Speaker 19>We're in public hearings.</v>

173
00:07:05,817 --> 00:07:08,780
<v Speaker 19>Do we have a speaker or many speakers?</v>

174
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,340
<v Speaker 19>I know we have one.</v>

175
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,601
<v Speaker 19>I feel like we have one.</v>

176
00:07:11,622 --> 00:07:13,764
<v Speaker 11>There are no speakers signed up.</v>

177
00:07:13,784 --> 00:07:14,064
<v Speaker 19>Okay.</v>

178
00:07:14,084 --> 00:07:20,370
<v Speaker 19>But do we have a presentation from the airport?</v>

179
00:07:21,177 --> 00:07:25,922
<v Speaker 01>I think I've got some slides to throw on the projector for reference as well.</v>

180
00:07:28,535 --> 00:07:35,551
<v Speaker 01>Watch him closely to so thank you all for I hope I don't take all of that.</v>

181
00:07:36,467 --> 00:07:40,623
<v Speaker 01>Thank you counselors for your time today excited to bring this before you for</v>

182
00:07:40,623 --> 00:07:44,941
<v Speaker 01>first hearing having gone through now committee of all the taxing authorities as</v>

183
00:07:44,941 --> 00:07:49,096
<v Speaker 01>well the TMAPC with unanimous support to this point obviously we will go back</v>

184
00:07:49,096 --> 00:07:51,849
<v Speaker 01>before the County Commission and yourselves as well</v>

185
00:07:51,991 --> 00:07:53,172
<v Speaker 01>for our final approvals.</v>

186
00:07:53,793 --> 00:08:08,575
<v Speaker 01>As discussed this is an expansion of some of the increment districts within our project plan does not change our project plan area at all but does expand a couple of those districts that fall within that original project plan boundary namely districts E,</v>

187
00:08:08,575 --> 00:08:20,505
<v Speaker 01>District B and District A as referred to on the map that was provided here to cover what was previously considered non-developable area that we hope to make a developable within that original project plan.</v>

188
00:08:20,543 --> 00:08:21,543
<v Speaker 01>Additionally,</v>

189
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:26,649
<v Speaker 01>it expands the capture potential based on the size of the projects that we've seen today.</v>

190
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:30,909
<v Speaker 01>You know, some of the projects like Norsun, which have been announced,</v>

191
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:33,005
<v Speaker 01>or Agile Space, which has been announced,</v>

192
00:08:33,005 --> 00:08:37,043
<v Speaker 01>are in themselves big enough to totally encompass the entire project plan area,</v>

193
00:08:37,043 --> 00:08:40,571
<v Speaker 01>not just outside of one district, but all the districts encompassing.</v>

194
00:08:40,744 --> 00:08:45,929
<v Speaker 01>So this right-sizes us based on the project sizes that we've seen for this development area.</v>

195
00:08:46,129 --> 00:08:49,032
<v Speaker 01>Lots of high-quality jobs that we're excited to continue to bring.</v>

196
00:08:49,012 --> 00:08:54,371
<v Speaker 01>to Tulsa and to the Tulsa Airport Improvement Trust lands.</v>

197
00:08:54,904 --> 00:09:05,726
<v Speaker 01>And so we continue to push for that development of that good land and good quality development in an industrial area that's owned for it and is well suited for it from the infrastructure investments that have been made previously in the area.</v>

198
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:08,151
<v Speaker 01>So we also</v>

199
00:09:08,857 --> 00:09:14,683
<v Speaker 01>in this contemplate the sales tax increment for the construction really because most of this is industrial,</v>

200
00:09:14,683 --> 00:09:19,801
<v Speaker 01>but the construction costs that goes into the development of those lands in districts A and B.</v>

201
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:22,469
<v Speaker 01>So again, thank you for your consideration today.</v>

202
00:09:22,692 --> 00:09:29,998
<v Speaker 01>Happy to answer any questions and thankful that we've had a unanimous support up to this point,</v>

203
00:09:29,998 --> 00:09:37,150
<v Speaker 01>but we'll continue to push and make good conversation and discussion with everybody involved.</v>

204
00:09:37,308 --> 00:09:37,989
<v Speaker 16>I'm Jeff Saban.</v>

205
00:09:38,049 --> 00:09:39,970
<v Speaker 16>I'm development counselor for the airport as well.</v>

206
00:09:40,071 --> 00:09:42,893
<v Speaker 16>I wanted to kind of go over just a little bit about the expansion.</v>

207
00:09:43,914 --> 00:09:47,518
<v Speaker 16>If you can go to the expansion slide images real quick.</v>

208
00:09:47,538 --> 00:09:53,984
<v Speaker 16>So you can see on each of the next three images where the different TIF districts are expanding.</v>

209
00:09:54,944 --> 00:10:04,193
<v Speaker 16>And Daniel had also mentioned that the budget will be increasing if you adopt these amendments from a total authorized budget of $98 million.</v>

210
00:10:04,173 --> 00:10:17,386
<v Speaker 16>to 975 million dollars and a good chunk of that is because when the original project plan was adopted back in 2015 these whale projects of a billion dollars plus investment weren't really on anyone's radar.</v>

211
00:10:18,371 --> 00:10:31,227
<v Speaker 16>That's really been a development the last five or six years and so with the addition of this increased land for several of these TIF districts it really increases the development potential of these sites.</v>

212
00:10:32,573 --> 00:10:34,075
<v Speaker 16>I just wanted to throw that out there.</v>

213
00:10:34,815 --> 00:10:40,662
<v Speaker 16>So we see TIFF 9D will be expanding to include some of the areas adjacent to the freeway.</v>

214
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:50,833
<v Speaker 16>And then Increments District A and E will be expanding to include areas that were going to be runways when the original project plan was considered.</v>

215
00:11:00,484 --> 00:11:02,226
<v Speaker 16>Oh, here's the E expansion.</v>

216
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:37,540
<v Speaker 16>obviously there won't be any development on the runways or taxiways but some of the surrounding lands are is developable okay all right I don't know mr.</v>

217
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:43,385
<v Speaker 16>city attorney can we ask questions during a public hearing</v>

218
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:54,768
<v Speaker 17>Typically not but this one's slightly different in that it's it's posted as For providing information from the project proponent.</v>

219
00:11:54,843 --> 00:12:01,375
<v Speaker 19>So I think in this case you can okay I Just have a question.</v>

220
00:12:01,415 --> 00:12:09,970
<v Speaker 15>I'm unfamiliar with the process of Undevelopable land becoming developable.</v>

221
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,533
<v Speaker 15>Well, what how does that happen?</v>

222
00:12:15,595 --> 00:12:16,276
<v Speaker 01>Happy to answer that.</v>

223
00:12:16,657 --> 00:12:23,070
<v Speaker 01>So some of what the TIF District E was originally purchased as a third parallel runway.</v>

224
00:12:23,711 --> 00:12:30,585
<v Speaker 01>The FAA has provided new guidance on what that capacity requirement is for additional plane takeoff and landing capacity.</v>

225
00:12:30,605 --> 00:12:35,325
<v Speaker 01>And so because that is no longer needed because the three runways we have today</v>

226
00:12:35,325 --> 00:12:36,818
<v Speaker 01>provide that capacity and</v>

227
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:38,771
<v Speaker 01>multiples of it.</v>

228
00:12:39,472 --> 00:12:43,335
<v Speaker 01>It was taken out of our master plan as an additional runway for development,</v>

229
00:12:43,335 --> 00:12:46,028
<v Speaker 01>and so that made it available for future development.</v>

230
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,139
<v Speaker 01>And then same for some of this that could, you know,</v>

231
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:50,677
<v Speaker 01>right now is a crosswind runway,</v>

232
00:12:50,677 --> 00:12:58,127
<v Speaker 01>but if it ever was determined that it didn't need to be within the remaining 25 years of that existing Local Development Act TIF that we have set up there,</v>

233
00:12:58,127 --> 00:13:01,492
<v Speaker 01>then that would free it up for future development in that same regard.</v>

234
00:13:03,018 --> 00:13:03,118
<v Speaker 15>Okay.</v>

235
00:13:03,138 --> 00:13:03,338
<v Speaker 15>Thank you.</v>

236
00:13:05,528 --> 00:13:06,149
<v Speaker 19>Anyone else?</v>

<v Speaker 18>scheduled for March 1st, 8th, 15th, 22nd, and 29th.</v>

296
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,767
<v Speaker 18>of March 2025 at 1 South Lewis Avenue.</v>

297
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,339
<v Speaker 18>Having fresh, nutritious,</v>

298
00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:02,015
<v Speaker 18>and delicious food available from local farms is a blessing.</v>

299
00:17:02,697 --> 00:17:08,667
<v Speaker 18>I am grateful for these farmers making nutritious food available that when eaten,</v>

300
00:17:08,647 --> 00:17:11,231
<v Speaker 18>can bring strength and vitality.</v>

301
00:17:11,852 --> 00:17:15,529
<v Speaker 18>And we know as we eat or read God's word, the Holy Bible,</v>

302
00:17:15,529 --> 00:17:19,077
<v Speaker 18>we receive spiritual nutrition, strength, and vitality.</v>

303
00:17:19,683 --> 00:17:22,787
<v Speaker 18>Again, yes to this Tulsa's farmers market.</v>

304
00:17:22,827 --> 00:17:27,073
<v Speaker 18>And thank you, counselors, for doing your best to help Tulsa be her best.</v>

305
00:17:29,116 --> 00:17:29,477
<v Speaker 19>Thank you.</v>

306
00:17:29,517 --> 00:17:30,338
<v Speaker 19>Next speaker, please.</v>

307
00:17:30,899 --> 00:17:33,743
<v Speaker 11>The next speaker is Mr. James Alexander, Jr.</v>

308
00:17:33,923 --> 00:17:35,245
<v Speaker 11>on item 4D.</v>

309
00:17:42,768 --> 00:17:43,228
<v Speaker 19>Good evening.</v>

310
00:17:43,509 --> 00:17:47,412
<v Speaker 00>Good evening, Councilor and my buddy, Mr. Larkin.</v>

311
00:17:47,432 --> 00:17:50,054
<v Speaker 00>How we doing this evening?</v>

312
00:17:50,074 --> 00:17:51,074
<v Speaker 00>Okay,</v>

313
00:17:51,074 --> 00:18:02,845
<v Speaker 00>I have a problem with this simply because of whether the area that it's in and then what's happening in North Tulsa entitlement area.</v>

314
00:18:02,865 --> 00:18:06,521
<v Speaker 00>Now North Tulsa is the only area in Tulsa,</v>

315
00:18:06,521 --> 00:18:12,266
<v Speaker 00>Oklahoma that has a plan that is set up by the federal government.</v>

316
00:18:13,683 --> 00:18:15,573
<v Speaker 00>Now, Crushfield has tried to get in on,</v>

317
00:18:15,573 --> 00:18:19,111
<v Speaker 00>they have gotten some money from community development block grant money.</v>

318
00:18:19,448 --> 00:18:25,474
<v Speaker 00>I know this is a tax increment district that's setting up one or more projects.</v>

319
00:18:26,595 --> 00:18:31,575
<v Speaker 00>But the problem I have is that Tulsa, North Tulsa,</v>

320
00:18:31,575 --> 00:18:38,646
<v Speaker 00>entitlement area has been set up since 1959 and received money in 1969.</v>

321
00:18:40,107 --> 00:18:42,930
<v Speaker 00>So there's where the problem lies.</v>

322
00:18:43,906 --> 00:18:50,328
<v Speaker 00>I don't want anything in North Tulsa developed before the entitlement area.</v>

323
00:18:50,975 --> 00:18:52,397
<v Speaker 00>And it's crazy not to think that.</v>

324
00:18:52,998 --> 00:19:00,948
<v Speaker 00>A sober Miami person that can read and halfway comprehend would have the same problem.</v>

325
00:19:00,968 --> 00:19:03,050
<v Speaker 00>If you look at North and go north,</v>

326
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:06,174
<v Speaker 00>you see everything that's not supposed to be there.</v>

327
00:19:07,295 --> 00:19:08,477
<v Speaker 00>And I know the reason why.</v>

328
00:19:08,537 --> 00:19:14,373
<v Speaker 00>Tulsa said that they would never have, I'm not going to use that,</v>

329
00:19:14,373 --> 00:19:16,079
<v Speaker 00>another black area.</v>

330
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:17,672
<v Speaker 00>And they're working towards the end.</v>

331
00:19:18,413 --> 00:19:19,114
<v Speaker 00>It's not going to happen.</v>

332
00:19:19,795 --> 00:19:22,279
<v Speaker 00>North Tulsa's going to develop as long as I'm alive.</v>

333
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:28,870
<v Speaker 00>It may not be long, but while I'm here, I'm going to work my butt off.</v>

334
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:29,872
<v Speaker 19>Thank you, Mr. Alexander.</v>

335
00:19:30,513 --> 00:19:32,857
<v Speaker 19>I'm assuming Mrs. Alexander is the next speaker?</v>

336
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:33,758
<v Speaker 02>Yes.</v>

337
00:19:34,058 --> 00:19:35,420
<v Speaker 19>Okay.</v>

338
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,422
<v Speaker 02>Good evening, Counselor.</v>

339
00:19:36,462 --> 00:19:36,882
<v Speaker 19>Good evening.</v>

340
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:37,564
<v Speaker 19>How are you?</v>

341
00:19:38,365 --> 00:19:38,846
<v Speaker 02>I'm well.</v>

342
00:19:39,527 --> 00:19:40,428
<v Speaker 02>Thanks for asking.</v>

343
00:19:40,688 --> 00:19:41,209
<v Speaker 19>You bet.</v>

344
00:19:41,229 --> 00:19:43,232
<v Speaker 02>Hope the same for you and the others.</v>

345
00:19:44,915 --> 00:19:46,297
<v Speaker 19>Are you speaking on 4D?</v>

346
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:47,058
<v Speaker 19>Yes.</v>

347
00:19:47,239 --> 00:19:47,539
<v Speaker 19>As well?</v>

348
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:54,250
<v Speaker 02>Okay.</v>

349
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:59,458
<v Speaker 02>I agree with what my husband just said, but another concern that I have</v>

350
00:20:00,653 --> 00:20:01,653
<v Speaker 02>is, um,</v>

351
00:20:01,653 --> 00:20:10,371
<v Speaker 02>there seems to be some water issues in the North Tulsa community continuously because there's been a lot of neglect,</v>

352
00:20:10,371 --> 00:20:13,828
<v Speaker 02>but a lot of work has been done the same time,</v>

353
00:20:13,828 --> 00:20:17,713
<v Speaker 02>but we still have a lot of work that needs to be done.</v>

354
00:20:19,515 --> 00:20:25,682
<v Speaker 02>So, you know, I'm thinking about this, this particular item and, um,</v>

355
00:20:28,177 --> 00:20:29,478
<v Speaker 02>the North Tulsa area.</v>

356
00:20:29,838 --> 00:20:34,216
<v Speaker 02>This is, uh, Crutchfield district, you say, but, um,</v>

357
00:20:34,216 --> 00:20:36,826
<v Speaker 02>I brought this article with me,</v>

358
00:20:36,826 --> 00:20:41,121
<v Speaker 02>changing the trajectory in declining neighborhoods.</v>

359
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:43,671
<v Speaker 02>And this is about North Tulsa.</v>

360
00:20:43,691 --> 00:20:47,494
<v Speaker 02>And there's a lot of conversation about North Tulsa concerning water issues.</v>

361
00:20:49,356 --> 00:20:55,830
<v Speaker 02>Most recently, the U S department of health and human services sent an $818,</v>

362
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:56,830
<v Speaker 02>000 check.</v>

363
00:20:57,252 --> 00:21:01,791
<v Speaker 02>to DHS to help people pay their water bills, because over 2,</v>

364
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:07,540
<v Speaker 02>300 people have been threatened to have their water service taken from them.</v>

365
00:21:07,636 --> 00:21:09,119
<v Speaker 02>And this is a continuous thing.</v>

366
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:14,772
<v Speaker 02>Most recently, we've been getting notices about lead in the pipes.</v>

367
00:21:15,764 --> 00:21:21,702
<v Speaker 19>Can you really focus your comments on just this particular item?</v>

368
00:21:21,855 --> 00:21:24,243
<v Speaker 19>I know you want to talk about water,</v>

369
00:21:24,243 --> 00:21:27,760
<v Speaker 19>but I don't think this has anything to do with water.</v>

370
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:31,673
<v Speaker 19>This is related to the Crutchfield neighborhood and the TIF.</v>

371
00:21:33,797 --> 00:21:38,245
<v Speaker 02>Well, I'm not sure how come you're planning to create</v>

372
00:21:38,917 --> 00:21:41,401
<v Speaker 02>district as a tax increment district.</v>

373
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:46,270
<v Speaker 02>But I know that that's been done in the North Tulsa community too.</v>

374
00:21:47,052 --> 00:21:52,862
<v Speaker 02>So basically I'm just saying that that area doesn't come up on the commute on the agenda.</v>

375
00:21:53,764 --> 00:21:58,632
<v Speaker 02>The North Tulsa area really doesn't come up on the agenda down here in your discussions.</v>

376
00:21:59,614 --> 00:22:00,756
<v Speaker 02>And I don't know how come.</v>

377
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:05,474
<v Speaker 19>If you if you ever want to comment just about water issues or whatever,</v>

378
00:22:05,474 --> 00:22:09,844
<v Speaker 19>you can sign up on the public comments section at the very end of the agenda,</v>

379
00:22:09,844 --> 00:22:13,533
<v Speaker 19>and then you can talk about just the water issues in North Tulsa.</v>

380
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,345
<v Speaker 19>If you'd like to do that, we can.</v>

381
00:22:16,387 --> 00:22:17,088
<v Speaker 19>We can help you.</v>

382
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,874
<v Speaker 19>Sign up for that for the following meeting.</v>

383
00:22:20,974 --> 00:22:21,975
<v Speaker 19>You can't do it for this one.</v>

384
00:22:22,336 --> 00:22:26,943
<v Speaker 02>OK, well, I'll take your advice on that and I will do it.</v>

385
00:22:29,426 --> 00:22:29,967
<v Speaker 02>Because.</v>

386
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:33,819
<v Speaker 02>That area needs to be included on the agenda.</v>

387
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,082
<v Speaker 02>There's a lot going on.</v>

388
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:36,926
<v Speaker 02>Thank you for your time.</v>

389
00:22:36,987 --> 00:22:38,911
<v Speaker 19>Okay, you bet.</v>

390
00:22:38,931 --> 00:22:39,673
<v Speaker 19>And do we have one more?</v>

391
00:22:41,197 --> 00:22:42,420
<v Speaker 11>We have two more speakers.</v>

392
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:45,728
<v Speaker 11>Mr. Stuart McDaniel on item 4D.</v>

393
00:23:04,608 --> 00:23:05,189
<v Speaker 19>How are you tonight?</v>

394
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:07,373
<v Speaker 14>Been better.</v>

395
00:23:08,295 --> 00:23:09,878
<v Speaker 14>Counselors, thank you for having me.</v>

396
00:23:09,978 --> 00:23:11,793
<v Speaker 14>Stuart McDaniel, H27 North Madison,</v>

397
00:23:11,793 --> 00:23:15,216
<v Speaker 14>right in the middle of District A as part of the Crutchfield plan.</v>

398
00:23:15,989 --> 00:23:17,672
<v Speaker 14>Been at this for seven years now.</v>

399
00:23:18,173 --> 00:23:25,587
<v Speaker 14>I'm just now getting to see some of the supporting documentation and it doesn't align with the sector plan or the small area plan.</v>

400
00:23:25,567 --> 00:23:31,565
<v Speaker 14>So I would respectfully ask the counselors to table it until I've had time to review it.</v>

401
00:23:32,034 --> 00:23:38,241
<v Speaker 14>The budget is severely decreased from what we had initially planned on generating.</v>

402
00:23:39,222 --> 00:23:43,642
<v Speaker 14>And a $8 million development that I am responsible for that we're using 1.</v>

403
00:23:43,642 --> 00:23:49,853
<v Speaker 14>2 million of the city's affordable housing trust fund money is excluded from development area A which is</v>

404
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:51,395
<v Speaker 14>par and course with the plan.</v>

405
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:53,397
<v Speaker 14>So respectfully,</v>

406
00:23:53,397 --> 00:23:55,982
<v Speaker 14>I just asked that it get tabled so that we can fix the documentation.</v>

407
00:23:56,843 --> 00:23:58,986
<v Speaker 19>How how what's your estimate?</v>

408
00:23:59,066 --> 00:24:00,729
<v Speaker 19>How long do you want us to table this item?</v>

409
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:03,513
<v Speaker 14>This is the first I've been able to be privy to it.</v>

410
00:24:03,673 --> 00:24:06,337
<v Speaker 14>I thought I would get to review it as we are the largest.</v>

411
00:24:06,417 --> 00:24:08,420
<v Speaker 14>We own 300 properties within this district.</v>

412
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,141
<v Speaker 14>I thought we</v>

413
00:24:09,796 --> 00:24:11,598
<v Speaker 14>would be a part of the planning process.</v>

414
00:24:11,638 --> 00:24:12,519
<v Speaker 14>I'm a little disappointed.</v>

415
00:24:12,739 --> 00:24:16,289
<v Speaker 14>So as quickly as they can get documents,</v>

416
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:19,839
<v Speaker 14>it's minor fixes if we can get it fixed.</v>

417
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:23,412
<v Speaker 14>Yeah, so is a month too long?</v>

418
00:24:23,952 --> 00:24:25,394
<v Speaker 14>I think that's too long.</v>

419
00:24:25,494 --> 00:24:28,918
<v Speaker 14>I would, whatever the next step, Aaron.</v>

420
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,281
<v Speaker 04>Sure.</v>

421
00:24:32,172 --> 00:24:34,940
<v Speaker 19>just help us out with this and then I think some counselors have some questions.</v>

422
00:24:34,995 --> 00:24:35,995
<v Speaker 04>So Mr.</v>

423
00:24:35,995 --> 00:24:39,399
<v Speaker 04>Stewart is correct and so we have changes to make to this Crutchfield TIF.</v>

424
00:24:39,719 --> 00:24:49,348
<v Speaker 04>We can make those changes fairly quickly so by the time we go to vote for the next time we can be ready for the vote giving Stewart a chance to look at it before we come for the next vote.</v>

425
00:24:49,768 --> 00:24:54,414
<v Speaker 19>Okay and then somebody that has their phone with them I don't have my phone is</v>

426
00:24:54,414 --> 00:24:59,001
<v Speaker 19>the do we have a meeting we don't have a meeting over spring break so I think</v>

427
00:24:59,001 --> 00:25:00,001
<v Speaker 19>it's the</v>

428
00:25:00,286 --> 00:25:01,668
<v Speaker 19>Is it the 12th that we have?</v>

429
00:25:02,629 --> 00:25:05,032
<v Speaker 19>Do we have a meeting on the 12th?</v>

430
00:25:05,052 --> 00:25:07,074
<v Speaker 19>Is the 12th too early, the 12th of March?</v>

431
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,476
<v Speaker 04>The 12th is not too early,</v>

432
00:25:08,476 --> 00:25:12,311
<v Speaker 04>and I take full responsibility for the mistakes that were in that project plan.</v>

433
00:25:13,421 --> 00:25:18,407
<v Speaker 19>Okay, so I hear that the 12th is okay if we move to table this until the 12th.</v>

434
00:25:18,567 --> 00:25:20,450
<v Speaker 14>I want time to work with the staff on it.</v>

435
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:21,010
<v Speaker 19>Okay.</v>

436
00:25:22,091 --> 00:25:26,817
<v Speaker 19>Okay, let me go with Councilor Hall-Harper and then Belis and anybody else?</v>

437
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,852
<v Speaker 19>Oh, okay.</v>

438
00:25:29,872 --> 00:25:30,213
<v Speaker 19>Bellis?</v>

439
00:25:30,874 --> 00:25:39,107
<v Speaker 03>Just out of curiosity or to understand kind of what led to you kind of being surprised by the documents you were seeing.</v>

440
00:25:39,508 --> 00:25:40,508
<v Speaker 03>Had you,</v>

441
00:25:40,508 --> 00:25:44,456
<v Speaker 03>were there ones shown to you previously and then they were changed or you just hadn't seen anything yet?</v>

442
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:45,818
<v Speaker 14>I hadn't gotten to see them at all.</v>

443
00:25:45,979 --> 00:25:46,780
<v Speaker 14>Okay.</v>

444
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,966
<v Speaker 14>We had prepared over the years, you all know what we've been going through.</v>

445
00:25:51,747 --> 00:25:54,591
<v Speaker 14>The documents we had prepared were a master district plan.</v>

446
00:25:55,272 --> 00:26:00,580
<v Speaker 14>And to a varying degree, we expected the city to modify them exponentially.</v>

447
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:06,088
<v Speaker 14>But this is kind of a wholesale thrown ours away and started from blank.</v>

448
00:26:06,108 --> 00:26:08,952
<v Speaker 14>And the map doesn't depict the project plan.</v>

449
00:26:08,993 --> 00:26:11,216
<v Speaker 14>It doesn't depict the intention of the community.</v>

450
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:14,100
<v Speaker 14>It doesn't align with the development</v>

451
00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:17,311
<v Speaker 14>or the pattern development of pattern development.</v>

452
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:21,636
<v Speaker 14>It excludes, it's just wrong on a few levels.</v>

453
00:26:21,716 --> 00:26:24,405
<v Speaker 14>And I was reviewing it sitting with Erin and I'm like,</v>

454
00:26:24,405 --> 00:26:25,750
<v Speaker 14>I don't want this voted on.</v>

455
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:26,841
<v Speaker 14>I want it right.</v>

456
00:26:27,021 --> 00:26:32,046
<v Speaker 14>You don't want your name on something that we have to almost wholesale fix and come back to you potentially.</v>

457
00:26:32,406 --> 00:26:33,287
<v Speaker 14>So let's just get it right.</v>

458
00:26:33,707 --> 00:26:34,388
<v Speaker 03>I'm sure we can.</v>

459
00:26:34,408 --> 00:26:37,151
<v Speaker 03>Thank you.</v>

460
00:26:37,171 --> 00:26:37,331
<v Speaker 19>Yeah.</v>

461
00:26:37,351 --> 00:26:37,631
<v Speaker 19>Okay.</v>

462
00:26:37,651 --> 00:26:40,294
<v Speaker 19>Any other council discussion with Stuart while he's here?</v>

463
00:26:42,136 --> 00:26:42,236
<v Speaker 19>Okay.</v>

464
00:26:42,256 --> 00:26:43,497
<v Speaker 19>Thank you all very much.</v>

465
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,192
<v Speaker 19>Do we have any other speakers?</v>

466
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:49,799
<v Speaker 11>Yes, we have a final speaker, Mr. Evan Taylor for item 4T.</v>

467
00:26:58,051 --> 00:26:58,351
<v Speaker 13>Hello.</v>

468
00:26:59,633 --> 00:27:01,456
<v Speaker 13>Mine's nowhere near as official as that, sorry.</v>

469
00:27:01,776 --> 00:27:04,320
<v Speaker 13>That was much more dramatic and awesome.</v>

470
00:27:04,655 --> 00:27:08,244
<v Speaker 13>Um, no, mine's actually in relation to, uh, for the past, uh,</v>

471
00:27:08,244 --> 00:27:11,127
<v Speaker 13>few months since October, um, I've been spending,</v>

472
00:27:11,127 --> 00:27:14,775
<v Speaker 13>I'm actually unemployed right now, so I spend my mornings, uh,</v>

473
00:27:14,775 --> 00:27:17,658
<v Speaker 13>applying for jobs, uh, doing interviews, whatnot,</v>

474
00:27:17,658 --> 00:27:21,306
<v Speaker 13>and then in the afternoons I spend my time cleaning up litter.</v>

475
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,421
<v Speaker 13>I love this city.</v>

476
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:25,746
<v Speaker 13>I've expressed that before actually up here as well when I was talking about speed limits.</v>

477
00:27:26,507 --> 00:27:27,759
<v Speaker 13>I love this city a lot,</v>

478
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:32,494
<v Speaker 13>care a lot about citizens and its health and well-being in regards to speeding as well,</v>

479
00:27:32,494 --> 00:27:34,290
<v Speaker 13>but also in regards to littering.</v>

480
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,813
<v Speaker 13>Since October, I've probably picked up over six tons of litter in this city,</v>

481
00:27:39,813 --> 00:27:43,090
<v Speaker 13>doing it each day, taking it to dumpsters and whatnot.</v>

482
00:27:43,231 --> 00:27:47,858
<v Speaker 13>But what disappoints me is the amount that we kind of ignore certain situations.</v>

483
00:27:47,838 --> 00:27:51,408
<v Speaker 13>these awesome fun runs don't get me wrong I love participating these kind of</v>

484
00:27:51,408 --> 00:27:55,025
<v Speaker 13>things I love drinking these I love being a part of this right but what often</v>

485
00:27:55,025 --> 00:27:58,596
<v Speaker 13>gets neglected is the cups that get thrown on the ground or the excess trash</v>

486
00:27:58,596 --> 00:28:02,072
<v Speaker 13>that gets thrown on the ground you know and I see police officers standing</v>

487
00:28:02,072 --> 00:28:05,595
<v Speaker 13>around not enforcing the penalties that we have for these kinds of things I</v>

488
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,832
<v Speaker 13>I get it, it's an overwhelming thing to say, hey,</v>

489
00:28:07,832 --> 00:28:09,977
<v Speaker 13>every police officer needs to write a ticket, right,</v>

490
00:28:09,977 --> 00:28:11,091
<v Speaker 13>for every bit of littering.</v>

491
00:28:11,735 --> 00:28:14,238
<v Speaker 13>But there could at least be some more teeth to this, right?</v>

492
00:28:14,678 --> 00:28:17,681
<v Speaker 13>What's instead being done, I call this the Midwest solution.</v>

493
00:28:17,721 --> 00:28:19,042
<v Speaker 13>It's something that I'm coining myself.</v>

494
00:28:19,522 --> 00:28:24,027
<v Speaker 13>We like to just run over trash and litter with lawn mowers and turn it into little tiny pieces.</v>

495
00:28:24,467 --> 00:28:26,229
<v Speaker 13>And then it gets washed into your water system.</v>

496
00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:28,551
<v Speaker 13>And then it becomes my problem because I have to drink it later on.</v>

497
00:28:28,631 --> 00:28:31,774
<v Speaker 13>So it is kind of my problem and I am driving past all this.</v>

498
00:28:31,894 --> 00:28:35,597
<v Speaker 13>So what I'd like to ask of the council is what are we going to</v>

499
00:28:35,577 --> 00:28:37,771
<v Speaker 13>to do to address things like, oh, you know,</v>

500
00:28:37,771 --> 00:28:44,098
<v Speaker 13>all the fun things that we have coming up in regards to all the litter that will be presented from these different projects.</v>

501
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,267
<v Speaker 13>Like I said, it's fun that we have these,</v>

502
00:28:46,267 --> 00:28:49,284
<v Speaker 13>but what do we do to protect the environment that we live in?</v>

503
00:28:51,001 --> 00:28:51,782
<v Speaker 13>That's my question.</v>

504
00:28:52,203 --> 00:28:55,186
<v Speaker 19>Yeah, no, that's good question posed to us.</v>

505
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:58,891
<v Speaker 19>Like I said at the beginning, this is not a question and answer time.</v>

506
00:28:58,911 --> 00:29:01,724
<v Speaker 19>We just received comments from the public,</v>

507
00:29:01,724 --> 00:29:04,872
<v Speaker 19>so I really do appreciate you bringing this up.</v>

508
00:29:05,019 --> 00:29:19,658
<v Speaker 19>What we can do afterwards is we can ask the person or the team that's responsible for these special permits to come talk to us about what their enforcement mechanisms are and what they require of the organizers.</v>

509
00:29:19,638 --> 00:29:22,862
<v Speaker 19>And then we can make tweaks if we see tweaks need to be made.</v>

510
00:29:23,022 --> 00:29:23,542
<v Speaker 13>I appreciate that.</v>

511
00:29:23,563 --> 00:29:25,465
<v Speaker 13>Like I said, just make sure we have some teeth behind it.</v>

512
00:29:25,485 --> 00:29:26,486
<v Speaker 13>That's all I ask.</v>

513
00:29:26,506 --> 00:29:26,966
<v Speaker 19>Yeah.</v>

514
00:29:26,986 --> 00:29:27,607
<v Speaker 19>Thank you very much.</v>

515
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:30,230
<v Speaker 19>Okay.</v>

516
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:32,252
<v Speaker 19>So no more speakers, right, Catherine?</v>

517
00:29:33,113 --> 00:29:33,714
<v Speaker 11>That is correct.</v>

518
00:29:33,954 --> 00:29:34,195
<v Speaker 19>Okay.</v>

519
00:29:34,996 --> 00:29:38,239
<v Speaker 19>So it sounds like we probably have two motions on this.</v>

520
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,862
<v Speaker 19>If you're ready to go, then I think you know how to do it.</v>

521
00:29:41,563 --> 00:29:41,783
<v Speaker 19>Thank you.</v>

522
00:29:41,803 --> 00:29:42,304
<v Speaker 19>Know what we need.</v>

523
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:46,880
<v Speaker 07>So for clarification, Mr. Chairman,</v>

524
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,448
<v Speaker 07>do we need to vote to remove D before we approve the others?</v>

525
00:29:50,627 --> 00:29:58,702
<v Speaker 19>You can probably just do D on its own first and then do B through Y minus D.</v>

526
00:29:58,702 --> 00:29:59,702
<v Speaker 19>Okay.</v>

527
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:09,255
<v Speaker 07>I move that we approve to withdraw 4D from the agenda and vote tonight.</v>

528
00:30:09,275 --> 00:30:11,578
<v Speaker 19>Entable it until?</v>

529
00:30:11,598 --> 00:30:13,120
<v Speaker 07>Entable it until March 12th.</v>

530
00:30:13,661 --> 00:30:14,282

<v Speaker 19>At five o'clock in this room.</v>

532
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,521
<v Speaker 07>At five o'clock in this room.</v>

533
00:30:17,641 --> 00:30:18,763
<v Speaker 08>Yes, second that.</v>

00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:20,705

<v Speaker 07>All right, Mr. Chair,</v>

570
00:31:29,918 --> 00:31:33,349
<v Speaker 19>I know and I just apologize to Councilor Bush.</v>

571
00:31:33,409 --> 00:31:36,278
<v Speaker 09>I told her this would be an easy motion to make and then it got real tricky.</v>

572
00:31:36,697 --> 00:31:38,299
<v Speaker 19>Yeah, that was a tricky one.</v>

573
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,954

<v Speaker 11>The first speaker is mr. James Alexander jr.</v>

611
00:33:15,016 --> 00:33:16,178
<v Speaker 11>On 7c</v>

612
00:33:21,693 --> 00:33:22,134
<v Speaker 19>Good evening.</v>

613
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:24,678
<v Speaker 19>Good talking to you about this one beforehand.</v>

614
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:27,803
<v Speaker 19>I said good talking to you about this one beforehand.</v>

615
00:33:29,986 --> 00:33:30,327
<v Speaker 00>It was 7D?</v>

616
00:33:30,347 --> 00:33:30,627
<v Speaker 00>7C.</v>

617
00:33:30,647 --> 00:33:33,932
<v Speaker 00>7C.</v>

618
00:33:34,634 --> 00:33:38,440
<v Speaker 00>Okay, this is dealing with code enforcement.</v>

619
00:33:39,421 --> 00:33:45,591
<v Speaker 00>And I have a really big problem with code enforcement in some of the ways that they be dealing with the public.</v>

620
00:33:46,448 --> 00:33:50,894
<v Speaker 00>And I don't think it's fair in the way that they do a lot of the work they do.</v>

621
00:33:50,914 --> 00:33:54,358
<v Speaker 00>But sometimes, most of the times, they'd be doing the right thing.</v>

622
00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:01,907
<v Speaker 00>Because this particular item, as we talked about, was standing water.</v>

623
00:34:03,189 --> 00:34:12,100
<v Speaker 00>And it also was about trash, weeds, weeds, and grass.</v>

624
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:16,185
<v Speaker 00>And when you talk about standing water, that's a health hazard.</v>

625
00:34:16,992 --> 00:34:22,447
<v Speaker 00>And I don't know how the city works with people that have those problems,</v>

626
00:34:22,447 --> 00:34:28,126
<v Speaker 00>but I think before you try to take money from people or take their property,</v>

627
00:34:28,126 --> 00:34:41,726
<v Speaker 00>that there should be some kind of way that it works out that each other come out home and not just the citizen be put out there just and can't handle what's being put in front of it.</v>

628
00:34:42,971 --> 00:34:43,472
<v Speaker 00>So</v>

629
00:34:45,393 --> 00:34:46,574
<v Speaker 00>that needs to be,</v>

630
00:34:46,574 --> 00:34:51,923
<v Speaker 00>is there a public thing talking with code enforcement at any type of meeting?</v>

631
00:34:52,082 --> 00:34:53,904
<v Speaker 00>Anybody having a meeting with code enforcement?</v>
